Use TLS 1.2 to communicate with Azure Logic Apps access endpoint APIs

You're receiving this email because you use Azure Logic Apps.



To improve secure communication with Logic Apps, we’re retiring support for Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.0 and 1.1. Starting on September 30, 2019, TLS 1.2 will be required to communicate with Logic Apps access endpoint APIs. To avoid service interruptions, update to TLS 1.2.



The affected APIs are request trigger and webhook callback URL. Azure Resource Manager APIs, including those used to create logic apps and resubmit runs, already require TLS 1.2 and won’t be affected.





Required action

Update to use TLS 1.2 to communicate with Logic Apps access endpoint APIs by September 30, 2019. If you currently use TLS 1.0 or 1.1, evaluate your TLS 1.2 readiness and develop a migration plan with the testing described in Solving the TLS 1.0 Problem.
